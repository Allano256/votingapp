# VOTING APP

![votingapp](assets/images/heroku_responsive.png)

This is a voting app that is designed to run for a period of two minutes, a period that can be adjusted depending on the need. During this period the voters are allowed to vote and when the time runsout, the application stops and gives results of the voting outcome.

The app is intended to solve voting in remote countries that continously use manual ways to tabulate votes and also physical papers for voters to tick their preferred candidate. 

This application is completely digital so it avoids voter result manipulation, creates transparency in the voting process and also saves time on logistics.
